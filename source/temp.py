s3="1   -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- to resolve america 's ongoing , bruising battle over the debt and deficit , house republican paul ryan and senate democrat patty murray announced a deal on december 10 to halt spending cuts -- mostly in defense -- and lock in a two-year budget agreement to avoid another government shutdown on january 15 . but in eagerly seeking agreement with the republicans who shut the government down in october , democrats risk hurting the economy 's fragile recovery by accepting too much budget austerity embedded in the newly adopted budget . president obama and the democrats won big over the republicans in october 's budget fight . instead of pressing their advantage , democrats took tax increases for the rich off the table , agreed to cut federal pensions and did not get unemployment benefits extended . the democrats basically threw away their political gains . the deal repeals less than half of the sequestration cuts planned for 2014 . if obama and congress continue their shortsighted obsession with austerity and budget cuts , they ignore the big economic lesson from the past several years : austerity hurts prosperity . the congressional budget office estimated that repealing the entire 2013-2014 spending cuts would increase gross domestic product by $ 113 billion and create 900,000 additional jobs next year . the october 2013 government shutdown took another $ 24 billion out of the gdp . unemployment remains stuck around 7 % . though the deal reduces a bit of fiscal uncertainty , it hardly affected the u.s. growth forecasts for big banks , despite bank economists citing some pessimism because of `` austerity shock '' from spending cuts and `` uncertainty shock '' from washington 's continued fiscal battles . republicans bargain for more cuts and fewer taxes , but cutting military spending makes them nervous , so they attack social security and medicare . the wall street-affiliated democratic group third way is helping . it launched an attack on sen. elizabeth warren , d-massachusetts , and others who rightly refuse to cut social security as part of a long-term budget solution . we all know that republicans like to defend the wealthy and slash government . but why does austerity , especially cuts to old-age programs , have credibility with obama and other democrats ? advocates of `` grand bargains , '' cutting programs to balance the budget , wrongly presume the budget is a fixed quantity . they imagine it like a fixed pie . programs for the young , like education , must be paid for by cutting other programs , like social security . but their belief that a dollar taken from the old will be spent on the young is not only divisive , mean and fierce -- it is wrong . in his december 6 speech on inequality , obama talked about the sky-high and stubborn child poverty rate : more than 24 % . but cutting social security and medicare will only destabilize the economy and increase the elderly poverty rate . in many countries , programs for elderly people are not traded off against help for the young . when support for old-age programs increases , so does spending on children . advanced democratic countries ' spending on the elderly is positively correlated with education spending . one analysis shows that a 10 % increase in spending on education is correlated with a 7.3 % increase in spending on pensions . the congressional budget office warns that long-term deficits can hurt the economy . want to reduce the debt and deficit ? tax the wealthy , which wo n't hurt the economy . economists emmanuel saez and thomas piketty estimate that raising the tax rate for the top 1 % as high as 80 % would generate far more revenue . sen. tom harkin , d-iowa , and rep. peter defazio , d-oregon , propose a transactions tax -- a three-penny charge on every $ 100 traded in the stock market , which the congressional budget office estimates would raise $ 352 billion over 10 years . this small tax would also reduce stock churning by speculators , creating a nice secondary benefit . want to find even more savings ? sen. harry reid , d-nevada , wisely put tax loopholes that cost the treasury almost a trillion dollars per year on the table . for example , reid called for eliminating the small , but noxious , tax break for buying yachts and the $ 17 billion break that comes from taxing private equity , real estate and hedge fund profits as `` carried interest '' rather than at the ordinary income rate of 39.6 % instead of the capital gains rate of 20 % . there is one piece of good news : the deficit is coming down , from 9.2 % when obama took office to 4.1 % of gdp in 2017 . faster economic growth would shrink the deficit more rapidly . in contrast , further spending cuts will slow the economy and deficit reduction along with it . so , this is no time for obama to accept a lower budget path , or to consider cuts in social security and medicare . the small budget deficit reductions in this deal -- less than one-half of 1 % of the total debt or $ 23 billion -- would almost pay for extended unemployment benefits for one year at $ 25 billion . democrats are flinching under continued pressure from republicans playing out their long game as they ready for another bitter fight when the debt limit is reached next spring . but the president and the democrats have a winning economic and political strategy : raise revenues and keep social security and medicare strong . do n't throw october 's hard-won victory away ; it wo n't help the elderly , it wo n't help children , and it wo n't help the economy . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of rick mcgahey and teresa ghilarducci .	 democrats and republicans reach a deal on the budget .   rick mcgahey , teresa ghilarducci : austerity in budget will hurt our economy .   they say president obama should not make cuts to programs like social security .   mcgahey , ghilarducci : taxing the wealthy would generate revenue and cut deficit ."
s4="123 new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- preliminary tests indicate ricin was found in letters sent this past weekend to new york mayor michael bloomberg , new york deputy police commissioner paul browne said wednesday . browne said the letters to bloomberg contained a threat to the mayor and mentioned the debate on gun laws . `` the letter obviously , referred to our anti-gun efforts but there 's 12,000 people -lrb- who -rrb- are going to get killed this year with guns and 19,000 that are going to commit suicide with guns , and we 're not going to walk away from those efforts , '' bloomberg said . one letter addressed to the mayor 's office was opened at the city government 's mail facility , browne said . the suspicious material found in the two letters was a `` pink-orange oily substance , '' he said , adding that it was the second of two tests that showed what appeared to be trace amounts of ricin . what is ricin ? the substance is being tested at the national bioforensic analysis center in maryland , with conclusive results expected by friday . some of the emergency services workers who touched the letter friday were examined after they showed minor intestinal symptoms of ricin exposure on saturday , browne said . the symptoms have since subsided . civilian workers showed no symptoms , browne said in a statement . `` we take a lot of security measures as you know , '' bloomberg said . `` the men and women that open the mail for example ... they are well trained . '' the second letter to the mayor was opened by mark glaze , director of mayors against illegal guns -- founded and co-chaired by bloomberg -- in washington on sunday . browne 's statement appeared to indicate glaze showed no symptoms . a spokeswoman for the organization declined to comment wednesday . opinion : ricin - almost never deadly . both letters were postmarked in shreveport , louisiana , on may 20 , the american postal workers union said on its website . bloomberg is an outspoken critic of current gun laws . in march , he said nationwide background checks on all gun sales would save lives . `` we know that 's true , because in states that already require background checks on private sales , the rate of women murdered by an intimate partner armed with a gun is 38 % lower than in states that do n't have such background checks , '' he said . fbi spokesman jim margolin told cnn the agency is working to determine from where the letters were sent and who sent them . if inhaled , injected or ingested , less than a pinpoint of ricin can kill a person within 36 to 48 hours because of the failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems . there is no known antidote for the toxin , which is derived from castor beans . it has been included in letters in the past few months sent to president barack obama and other officials . in april , letters were sent to obama ; sen. roger wicker , r-mississippi ; and sadie holland , a judge in lee county , mississippi . james everett dutschke of tupelo , mississippi , has been charged with possession and use of a biological agent in connection with the case . last week , fbi agents arrested matthew ryan buquet after a grand jury charged him with mailing threatening communication to a senior judge in the u.s. district court for the eastern district of washington state . the fbi said in a statement that tests -- conducted by that agency and the spokane regional health district -- showed that a suspicious substance found with the letter was `` active ricin toxin . '' there are no indications the cases are connected . man , 37 , arrested in probe of washington state ricin-laced letters . cnn 's deborah feyerick , jason kessler , lawrence crook iii , carol cratty and mary snow contributed to this report .	 new : suspicious substance was oily , new york police official says .   new : postal union says letters were postmarked in shreveport , louisiana .   letters were addressed to bloomberg , one went to an organization he founded .   ricin is a toxin that can kill in a matter of days .

s5="975 london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- human rights and freedom of the press in china , the detention of terrorist suspects by the united states and russia 's treatment of political dissent are the focus of scrutiny in amnesty international 's annual report , released wednesday , which looks at the state of human rights around the world . amnesty international protestors outside the us supreme court in january dressed as guantanamo bay detainees . the 398-page report comes 60 years after the united nations adopted the universal declaration of human rights , and amnesty says governments still need to act on their promises . `` the biggest threat to the future of human rights is the absence of a shared vision and collective leadership , '' the organization said in a statement . irene khan , amnesty 's secretary-general , said that in particular , `` the human-rights flash points in darfur , zimbabwe , gaza , iraq and myanmar demand immediate attention . '' the report , the group said , `` reveals a world riven by inequality , scarred by discrimination and distorted by political repression . '' according to its count , people are tortured or subject to other ill treatment in at least 81 countries , face unfair trials in at least 54 countries and are not allowed to express themselves freely in at least 77 countries . of the 150 countries and regions listed in the report , amnesty paid particular attention to china , the host of this summer 's olympic games . the group said growing numbers of human rights activists were imprisoned or harassed in china in 2007 , with ethnic and religious minorities -- including tibetans , falun gong practitioners and christians -- repressed or persecuted . death penalty statistics in china are difficult to assess , amnesty said , but based on public reports , the group estimated that at least 470 people were executed in 2007 . amnesty also noted the repression of free speech in china and said censorship of the internet and other media intensified last year . `` the chinese authorities maintained efforts to tightly control the flow of information , '' the report said . `` they decided what topics and news stories could be published , and media outlets were sometimes required to respond within minutes to government directives . the authorities continued to block web sites and to filter internet content based on specified words and topics . '' around 30 journalists and at least 50 others are known to be in prison for posting their views online , amnesty said . amnesty also criticized the death penalty in the united states , where 42 people were executed last year . it noted new jersey 's decision in december to abolish the death penalty made it the first u.s. state in more than 40 years to do away with executions . as it has in previous annual reports , amnesty criticized the detention of hundreds of foreign nationals at the u.s. naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba . `` the usa must close guantanamo detention camp and secret detention centers , prosecute the detainees under fair trial standards or release them , and unequivocally reject the use of torture and ill-treatment , '' amnesty said . the group noted that guantanamo detainees are held indefinitely , most of them without charge and without recourse to u.s. courts . most detainees there are held in isolation in maximum-security facilities , heightening concerns for their physical and mental health , amnesty said . in fact , more is written on the united states than any other country listed in the report . asked about that at a press conference tuesday , khan said , `` we certainly devote a lot of time to sudan , to china , to zimbabwe and other countries . but we look to the u.s. to provide leadership around the world . governments around the world look to the united states as a role model for their own behavior . '' in a lengthy section on iraq , amnesty noted that thousands of civilians , including children , were killed or injured in ongoing sectarian violence during 2007 . `` all sides involved in the fighting committed gross human rights violations , some of which amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity , '' the report said . abductions , torture and murder , with bodies left in the street , occur daily , and the violence has caused 2 million iraqis to flee to syria , jordan and elsewhere , amnesty said . u.s. forces held some 25,000 detainees `` without charge or trial , '' the group said , and 33 people were executed , `` some after grossly unfair trials . '' in afghanistan , conflict and insecurity aggravated by drought and floods contributed to `` large-scale displacement '' of people throughout the year . `` at least 6,500 people were estimated to have been killed in the context of the conflict , '' the report said . `` violations of international humanitarian and human rights law were committed with impunity by all parties , including afghan and international security forces and insurgent groups . '' russia must show greater tolerance for political dissent , amnesty said . `` the russian authorities were increasingly intolerant of dissent or criticism , branding it ` unpatriotic , ' '' the report said . `` a crackdown on civil and political rights was evident throughout the year and in particular during the run-up to the state duma -lsb- parliament -rsb- elections in december . '' the european court of human rights ruled that russia was responsible for enforced disappearances , torture and extrajudicial executions in 15 judgments relating to the recent conflict in chechnya , amnesty said . there were fewer reported disappearances in the chechen republic in 2007 than in previous years , amnesty said , but continued human rights violations made people reluctant to report abuses . the report also criticized human rights conditions in iran , gaza and myanmar . human rights conditions in zimbabwe continued to decline in 2007 , the report said , `` with an increase in organized violence and torture and restrictions on the rights to freedom of association , assembly and expression . '' members of the main opposition party , the mdc , along with other human rights defenders , were arrested , and many were tortured while in custody , amnesty said . some 4 million people required food aid because of the nation 's deteriorating economy , and victims of forced evictions in 2005 continued to live in `` deplorable conditions '' while president robert mugabe 's government failed to remedy their situation . `` human rights problems are not isolated tragedies , but are like viruses that can infect and spread rapidly , endangering all of us , '' khan said . `` governments today must show the same degree of vision , courage and commitment that led the united nations to adopt the universal declaration of human rights 60 years ago . ''"

s7="0	editor 's note : in our behind the scenes series , cnn correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events . here , soledad o'brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill . an inmate housed on the `` forgotten floor , '' where many mentally ill inmates are housed in miami before trial . miami , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the ninth floor of the miami-dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the `` forgotten floor . '' here , inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they 're ready to appear in court . most often , they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer -- charges that judge steven leifman says are usually `` avoidable felonies . '' he says the arrests often result from confrontations with police . mentally ill people often wo n't do what they 're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid , delusional , and less likely to follow directions , according to leifman . so , they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed , but not getting any real help because they 're in jail . we toured the jail with leifman . he is well known in miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill . even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards , we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor . go inside the ` forgotten floor ' '' at first , it 's hard to determine where the people are . the prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes . imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that 's kind of what they look like . they 're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves . that 's also why they have no shoes , laces or mattresses . leifman says about one-third of all people in miami-dade county jails are mentally ill . so , he says , the sheer volume is overwhelming the system , and the result is what we see on the ninth floor . of course , it is a jail , so it 's not supposed to be warm and comforting , but the lights glare , the cells are tiny and it 's loud . we see two , sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes , sometimes naked , lying or sitting in their cells . `` i am the son of the president . you need to get me out of here ! '' one man shouts at me . he is absolutely serious , convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the white house . leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system , occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital , only to return to jail to face their charges . it 's brutally unjust , in his mind , and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in miami . over a meal later , we talk about how things got this way for mental patients . leifman says 200 years ago people were considered `` lunatics '' and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them . they were just considered unfit to be in society . over the years , he says , there was some public outcry , and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals . but leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down . where did the patients go ? nowhere . the streets . they became , in many cases , the homeless , he says . they never got treatment . leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals , and today that number has been reduced 90 percent , and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals . the judge says he 's working to change this . starting in 2008 , many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the `` forgotten floor '' will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment , not just punishment . leifman says it 's not the complete answer , but it 's a start . leifman says the best part is that it 's a win-win solution . the patients win , the families are relieved , and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again . and , for leifman , justice is served . e-mail to a friend ."
